# MATLAB-Turbidity-Sensor
A student project for ENGR114 at Portland Community College. Uses MATLAB to read a turbidity sensor connected to an Arudino over serial.
# Problem Statement
Our group was tasked with creating MATLAB code to call data from an Arduino hooked up to a
turbidity sensor for the hydroponic fish tank-garden in the engineering department. 
Using Arduino and MATLAB the water turbidity produced from TSW-10
turbidity sensor measurements will be uploaded to ThingSpeak via Arduino and then
downloaded to MATLAB where progressive turbidity data will be stored and plotted against
time for any necessary reference. A plot of the turbidity as a function of time will also be generated for a visual representation of the turbidity.  The Arduino will produce an analog reading for turbidity that is converted to a voltage reading (where more voltage is less turbid water), then which MATLAB outputs the NTU reading for correct tubidity units.
